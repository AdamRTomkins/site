<p>The <strong>shoulder to wrist</strong> measurement determines your sleeve length, and runs from the shoulder point along the arm to your wrist.</p>

<p>To measure your <strong>shoulder to wrist</strong> measurement, place your tape measure at your shoulder point.
Let your arm hang naturally in a slight bend, and measure along your slightly bended arm up to your wrist.</p>
