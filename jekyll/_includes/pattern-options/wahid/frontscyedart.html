{% include pattern-option.html pattern='wahid' option='frontScyeDart' %}
<p>This pattern comes with a default 1 cm scye dart (think armhole dart) at the front.</p>

<p>You can increase or decrease the dart to influence the armhole.</p>

  <h5>What's the point?</h5>

  <p>The point of this dart is to make sure the armhole lies flat against your body, rather than gape.
Given that there is no sleeve, a gaping armhole is particularly unsightly.</p>

<blockquote class="tip">
  <p>While this dart is used to shape the pattern, you don't have to sew the dart because it's incorporated in the front dart.</p>
