<p>How much do you want the sleeve to be wider than your upperarm circumference?</p>

  <h5>What's the point?</h5>

  <p>It's actually men with big arms who prefer a tighter fit, and this less ease here. That's because it draws attention to their strong upper arms.</p>

  <p>If your upper arms are more skinny, you'll want some more ease here to smooth things out a bit.</p>
