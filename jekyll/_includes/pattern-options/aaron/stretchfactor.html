<p>How much does your fabric stretch?  Choose 0% if your fabric does not stretch.</p>

  <p>This <b>stretchFactor</b> option does only impact stretch one-way (horizontal).</p>

  <p>Four-way stretch is not really a concern for this top, but if you want you can play with the <b>lenghtBonus</b> option.</p>
