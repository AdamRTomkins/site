<h5>Units in freesewing</h5>
<p>Units are used in freesewing to parse user input (the <code>in</code> units) 
and convert pattern output (the <code>out</code> units).</p>
<p>Internally however, freesewing always uses 1mm for 1 SVG unit
and is thus entirely metric.</p>
<p>For more info on units, see FIXME</p>
