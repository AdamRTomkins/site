{% include pattern-option.html pattern='trent' option='crotchCurveFactor' %}

This option controls the bend of the crotch curve (in the front trouser panel).

Higher values make the crotch curve deeper, and more scooped out.
Lower values result in a flatter curve and thus a shorter crossseam.

Choose a too high value, and the deeply curved crossseam will cause _whiskers_ around your crotch.

Choose a too low value and you'll get _camel toe_.

> It's best to start with the default and only tweak this after a muslin test shows it's needed.
