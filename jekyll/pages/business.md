## Is freesewing a threat to my pattern business?
 
Freesewing is/are essentially open source sewing patterns.

If you fear for your pattern business, take comfort in the fact that open source software 
has existed (and thrived) for decades. 

Does that mean that software companies can't make any
money? Of course not.

As I wrote on [our about page](/about/#for-designers), I think freesewing can actually help you make more money.

In addition to that, please understand that I am unequivocally on your side. I want to see you, and your pattern business, succeed.

I also happen to believe that freesewing can help you with that.

Not only that, adoption of the freesewing platform by a commercial pattern company sits at the top of my list of achievements that I hope this project may accomplish.

That is because I believe that the chances that a software project will enure the test of time are much higher when it puts food on the table. Perhaps not on my table, but on some table, somewhere. Maybe yours?

## Is freesewing an opportunity for my pattern business?

I believe it is. Double so if you are a new company, or thinking of starting one. 

That's because if you already have a stack of patterns, there's going to be overhead to port them to the platform.
But if you're just starting out, you could give freesewing a chance with virtually no overhead.

We essentially do what Lekala and Bootstrap fashion do: Made-to-measure sewing patterns.

But we are an open source project, so you can take our code and built upon it.
In addition, we've made great effort to make frontend integration as simple as possible, and we even provide all source code of our own website.

So please, use our code in any way you see fit.

## Can I have my patterns on freesewing.org?

Yes. We will gladly host your patterns on freesewing.org assuming they are free of charge and open source.

Not only will we host them for you, we'll also help to port them to the freesewing platform.
As a matter of fact, you wouldn't be the first designer to do so.

However, chances are you want to sell your patterns. 
In that case, you can still use the freesewing platform, but you'll have to run your own instance.

## What would it take to run my own instance?

You will need to:

  - [Setup an instance of freesewing core](/docs/install)
  - Hook it up to your website/frontend

The first step is documented on this site, and we'll be happy to support you to the best of our abilities, and share our advice and experience.

The second step is exactly as complex as setting up a website for any other pattern company. Including user management, shopping cart, payments, and a bunch of other stuff that we can't help you with.
