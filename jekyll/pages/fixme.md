## This page captures all links to /fixme

Sometimes, while working on something, we need to link to a place that 
does not exist yet. So we link to /fixme because _fixme_ is self-explanatory.

To prevent that they all are broken links, this page captures them, so
our htmlproofer does not complain.

If you ended up here from a link somewhere, that link needs fixing.
Feel free to [create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/freesewing/site/new) for that.
