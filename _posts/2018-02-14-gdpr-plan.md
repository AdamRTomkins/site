This blog post is about the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union (EU). 
More precisely, it's about we plan to do to ensure that all your rights are respected when you browse freesewing.org.
A case-study if you will.

THis risks becoming a longread, so here's a table of contents:

## About the EU's GDPR

I have a love/hate relationship with the European Union. 
I love what they do and what they stand for, I hate how they do it.

The GDPR is no different. It's an important piece of legislation the raises the bar for online privacy, which is great.
But as I was doing research into the subject, all I ever wanted to do was rage-quit because OMG bureaucrats.

Allow me to explain.

### Privacy needs protection
For better of for worse (I believe for worse) the internet has settled in a modus operandi 
where you pay for *free stuff* with your personal data. 
Some people call it [people farming](https://ar.al/notes/we-didnt-lose-control-it-was-stolen/), and I think that's a great term.

The Googles and Facebooks of this world are vacuuming up ever more of our personal lives, 
and short of never going online, there seems to be little we can do about it.

### Why the EU is the best
This problem is too big to tackle by any of us. 
Who could possibly stand up to the combined power of the tech giants?

Well, how's this for a CV:

  - fined Facebook 110 million euro for misleading statements about their WhatsApp purchase
  - ordered Amazon to pay 250 million euro extra taxes in Luxembourg 
  - fined Google 2.4 billion Euro for abusing its dominant position in search
  - ordered Apple to pay 13 billion Euro extra taxes in Ireland

{%

%}

When it comes to tech giants, the European Union is all stick/no carrot.

The General Data Protection Regulation enforces privacy policies that respect users' rights.
It applies to all EU citizens, all the time, everywhere. 

Doesn't matter if you're a silicon valley juggernaut, respect the rights of the EU citizens or face the wrath of the eurocracy:

> Organizations in breach of GDPR can be fined up to 4% of annual global turnover or 20 Million euro (whichever is greater)
{:.quote.full}

Four percent of global turnover is a very big stick.

### Why the EU is the worst

{% 
include floatimgonlarge.html url="/img/blog/gdpr-plan/complicated.gif" 
description="What I imagine a Article 29 Working Party looks like" 
%}
The EU being the EU, the regulation is a mixed bag of lofty goals and ideals, watered down by lobbying groups, and further complicated by the compromise required to get 28 member states on board.

The intentions are great, it's a great idea, but they totally half-assed the implementation.

Speaking of which, the practical implementation is nowhere near finished. It's in the hands of the so-called *Article 29 Working Party*
which is currently keeping busy designing icons (I am not making this up), and will change its name to the 
*European Data Protection Board* come May 25th, because you wouldn't want to get too comfortable with all this jargon now, would you?

## What you need to know about GDPR

Googling GDPR feels like something that should only be done in *incognito mode*, because almost all results will be from people/companies 
who are trying to get your money in return for helping you understand GDPR.

That's right, there's so much confusion out there of what this thing does, or what it means, that there's an entire ecosystem of 
companies trying to cash in on the confusion by selling their advice/consultancy/snakeoil. 

This is sadly the case for many other parts of EU legislation too, but I've never seen it to this effect.
It is getting really hard to get to relevant information, in no small part due to the EU's signature ineptness to sell itself.

If you really want to know what GDPR is, the best thing you can do is 
[read the damn thing](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679). It ain't no rocket science.

If legislative texts make you run for the hills, the UKs ICO has 
[easily one of the best guides on GDPR](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/).

If you have a merely passing interest in the GDPR and what it takes for website operators such as ourselves
to be compliant, read on.

### The rights of EU citizens with regard to data processing

The EU enshrines basic rights for its citizens that should be respected.
The GDPR lists those rights as:

  content="<h5>The right to be informed</h5>
    <p>You need to be transparent about how you use personal data. Why you collect it, how you use it, and so on.</p>
 "

## Making freesewing GDPR-compliant: A case study

I'm not going to write a blog post about the GDPR as such. If you're into that kind of thing, perhaps this is not the site for you.

But I do think it's interesting to look at what we plan on doing to be GDPR compliant.  A case-study if you want. Let's do this:

### The deadline: May 25th

The GDPR exists for a while, but it's won't grow its teeth until May 25th 2018.Until that day, you get a pass. After that day, it's for real.

So we have like, 3 months left to get our house in order.

### The good news: We are small

Organisations employing fewer than 250 people are exempt from some of the more bureaucratic aspects of the GDPR, such as a bunch of documenting requirements.
Essentially, while you still have to do the right thing, there's a lot less paperwork to fill out.

Freesewing employs zero people, so we're off the hook. 

### What is personal data, what is sensitive data?
GDPR applies to *personal data*, and has extra provisions for *sensitive data*. 

What exactly is personal data? Well, in our case it's all data we collect from you.

On the list of things that qualify as sensitive data is biometric data. Are body measurements biometric data? Turns out they are not. Biometric data is what you can use to identify a person, like a fingerprint or iris scan. Body measurements alone won't cut it, so we 're good.

### It's (almost) all about consent

Consent --- getting your permission --- sits at the heart of the GDPR. Essentially, you need to ask permission for everything. And you can't throw up a bit terms and conditions wall of text, and have 'ok' button at the end. 

Now, consent my be granular, clear, transparent, and every adjective you can think of that says *Don't be a dick*.

There's a lot to pick apart in the consent corner alone, but let's focus on a few things:

#### Granularity

You can't just get blanket consent, you need to get consent for every type of data processing you do. Here at freesewing, we have identified three different types of data processing:

 - Profile data
 - Model data
 - Patron data

##### Profile data

This is your email address, password, avatar, perhaps your twitter handle, and so on.

We need (some of) this data to be able to authenticate you, and to create a community. As in, you can leave comments, other people can see who you are on twitter, and so on.

##### Model data

These are the measurements of your model(s). We need these to generate drafts.

##### Patron data

Depending on the tier of patron, we store your shipping address and birthday. We need these to be able to ship you things, or send you a birthday card at the right time.

#### Timing for consent

Consent must be asked when the data is collected. With our three types of data processing, that means that consent must be asked at different times:

 - Profile data: When signing up on the site
 - Model data: When creating the first model
 - Patron data: When becoming a patron

### Individual rights

Even when we get consent, we need to make sure we respect the individual rights of our users. Well, technically only of those users who are EU citizens, but we're going to do the same for all obviously.

The individual rights are:


   - The right to be informed
   - The right of access
   - The right to rectification
   - The right to erasure
   - The right to restrict processing
   - The right to data portability
   - The right to object
   - Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling

Let's see how they affect us:

#### The right to be informed
> The right to be informed encompasses your obligation to provide ?fair processing information?, typically through a privacy notice.  
> It emphasises the need for transparency over how you use personal data.

We're not allowed to do shady things, but must be open and transparent about why we collect data, how we process it, and so on.

That's not going to be a problem for us, we are transparent to fault. 

#### The right of access
> Under the GDPR, individuals will have the right to obtain:
>
> - confirmation that their data is being processed;
 > -access to their personal data; and
> - other supplementary information ? this largely corresponds to the information that should be provided in a privacy notice (see Article 15).

People need to be able to access the data we collect.

Once again, not a problem. It's all right here on the website.

#### The right to rectification

> Individuals are entitled to have personal data rectified if it is inaccurate or incomplete.

People have a right to correct their data if it's not correct.

The only data we have is the data you entered here on the site. If it's not correct, you can jump right back in and edit it. Once again, we're good.

#### The right to erasure
> The right to erasure is also known as ?the right to be forgotten?.
>
> The broad principle underpinning this right is to enable an individual to request the deletion or removal of personal data where there is no compelling reason for its continued processing.

People have the right to have their data removed/erased.

Once again, we are already compliant. You can remove your account at any time, and we will trash all your data right then, right there.

#### The right to restrict processing
> Individuals have a right to ?block? or suppress processing of personal data.
>
> When processing is restricted, you are permitted to store the personal data, but not further process it.

This right means that users must be able to put a *freeze* on all data processing, without going as far as to delete their data.

In our case, we would need to give a way for users to merely disable or freeze their account rather than removing. The side effect of such a disabled account would be that we wouldn't touch any of the data in it.

An open question is how one would un-freeze their account, given that we're not supposed to process their data. 

#### The right to data portability
> The right to data portability allows individuals to obtain and reuse their personal data for their own purposes across different services.  
> It allows them to move, copy or transfer personal data easily from one IT environment to another in a safe and secure way, without hindrance to usability.

People not only have a right to export all their data, that export should also be in a format that makes it easy for them to take their data elsewhere.

We already respect this right. We have an export tool that exports all data we have on file (minus passwords). Furthermore, apart from drafts and images, the textual data is exported to both JSON and YAML to ensure portability.

#### The right to object
> Individuals have the right to object to:
>
> - processing based on legitimate interests or the performance of a task in the public interest/exercise of official authority (including profiling);
> - direct marketing (including profiling); and
> - processing for purposes of scientific/historical research and statistics.


The right to object needs some clarification: 

#### Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling

> The GDPR has provisions on:
>
> - automated individual decision-making (making a decision solely by automated means without any human involvement);and
> - profiling (automated processing of personal data to evaluate certain things about an individual). Profiling can be part of an automated decision-making process.


### A sense of purpose

One most have a lawful basis for collecting data. Essentially, a purpose.
