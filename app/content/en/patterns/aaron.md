        This Aaron has increased ease for a more loose fit, 
        a lower neckline, narrower shoulder straps, and its 
        lenght is cropped just a smidge.  
        These modifications make it more of a girly tank top.

        <b>A note about breasts</b>
        <br> 
        This is originally a menswear pattern, so if you have 
        breasts to fit in, it's best to use your high bust 
        measurement as chest circumference.  
        <br>    
        This draft comes with 12cm (almost 5 inch) ease at 
        the chest, so you have some room to fit your bust.
