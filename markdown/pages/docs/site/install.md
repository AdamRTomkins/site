## System requirements

- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
- [Html-Proofer](https://rubygems.org/gems/html-proofer/versions/3.4.0)

## Installing Jekyll

The freesewing documentation is a static HTML site generated by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

If you don't have Jekyll on your system, please follow the 
[Jekyll install instructions](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

## Install from GitHub

With Jekyll setup, you can clone the site repository from GitHub:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:freesewing/site.git 
```

This will create the `site` directory with our code inside.

## Generate the HTML
To browse the documentation, cd into the `site` folder and 
enter the following command:

```
bundle exec jekyll build
```

The site will be generated in the `_site` subdirectory.

## Incremental builds

While you're making changes to the documentation, generating the site
every time you want to see the results is not very practical.

Instead, use this command to serve the site and have it auto-build
pages when you change them:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve --port 8000 --incremental
```

To run this in the background and silence the output, use this command:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve --port 8000 --incremental > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```

## Running Html-Proofer

If you'd like to submit your changes back to our repository, you 
should run the Html-Proofer to check for broken links.

Run this command to do so:

```
bundle exec htmlproofer _site --disable-external --assume-extension --file-ignore /apigen/
```
