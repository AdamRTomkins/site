## What you need

> #### Where to get all this stuff>
> 
> Making Jaeger is a fun and rewarning project, but getting all the required bits and pieces can be challenging.
>
> That is because this kind of project is somewhat more ambitious than the typical home sewing project,
> and as a result, your local haberdashery is unlikely to stock all of these things.
>
> If you know where to get them, great. If not, you can get a **Jacket trim pack** from 
> [Kenton Trimmings](http://kentontrimmings.co.uk/shop/) in London, they ship to international customers.
>
> It's a shop for professionals (they're not even open on Saturdays) but they don't require you to be a business 
> to place an order.
>
> I have no afiliation with these guys, but it's the only place I know of that will sell you a kit of
> professional trimmings to make a jacket.
>
> If you know of any other place that carries this stuff, please let us know about it.


To make Jaeger, you will need the following:

 - About two and a half meters of a suitable fabric (see [Fabric options](#fabric-options)
 - Lining fabric, optionally different sleeve lining fabric
 - Two larger buttons for the front, and 8 buttons for the sleeves
 - A bit of lightweight fusible interfacing for local enforcement
 - Canvas for the fronts and collar
 - Tailor's tape for the front edges
 - Some domette for interlining
 - Shoulder pads
 - Sleevehead wadding, with canvas if possible
 - Undercollar fabric

## Fabric options

Sportscoats are typically made from a heavier wool, often with some texture or pattern in the weave.
In general, they are made in *busier* fabrics.

Style purists will argue that sportscoats should never be made out of suiting fabric, as a sportscoat 
is not a suit jacket. You can tell them go feck off and do whatever you want, it's your jacket.

However, making Jaeger is going to take some time. Do yourself a favour and get something nice for the final project.
(because you will be making a muslin, right?)

## Cutting

 - **Main fabric**
   - Cut **2 fronts** (part 1)
   - Cut **2 front facings** (look for the facing/lining boundary on the front part)
   - Cut **2 backs** (part 2)
   - Cut **2 sides** (part 3)
   - Cut **2 topsleeves** (part 4)
   - Cut **2 undersleeves** (part 5)
   - Cut **1 collar** (part 6)
   - Cut **1 collarstand** (part 8)
   - Cut **2 pockets** (part 9)
   - Cut **1 chest pocket welt** (part 10)
 - **lining fabric**
   - Cut **2 fronts** (part 1)
   - Cut **2 front linings** (look for the facing/lining boundary on the front part, and don't forget to attach the inner pocket facing extension)
   - Cut **2 backs** (part 2)
   - Cut **2 sides** (part 3)
   - Cut **2 topsleeves** (part 4) Note: Some people like to use different lining for the sleeves
   - Cut **2 undersleeves** (part 5) Note: Some people like to use different lining for the sleeves
   - Cut **2 chest pocket bags** )(part 11)
   - Cut **2 inner pocket welts**
   - Cut **2 inner pocket bags** (part 13)
 - **Canvas**
   - Cut **2 fronts** on bias (part 1) Note: Don't include seam allowance
   - Cut **2 chest pieces** on bias. Look for the indication on the front part. Note: Don't include seam allowance
 - **Undercollar fabric**
   - Cut **1 undercollar** (part 7)

> When cutting out two, you can cut them [good sides together](/docs/sewing/good-sides-together).
> However, when working with fabric with a pattern, I prefer to cut them individually to finely control the pattern matching.
>
> When you cut them individually, remember that they need to be mirror images of each other. So flip either your pattern or your fabric over when cutting the second one.

### Caveats

 - The front facing and lining is marked on the front piece. For the facing, you'll have to attach the extension.
 - The chest piece is also marked on the front.
 - Don't include seam allowance when cutting out canvas, and cut it on bias.
