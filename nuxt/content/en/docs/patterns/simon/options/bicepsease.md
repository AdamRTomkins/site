How much do you want the sleeve to be wider than your upperarm circumference?

> #### What's the point?
> 
> It's actually men with big arms who prefer a tighter fit, and this less ease here. That's because it draws attention to their strong upper arms.
>
> If your upper arms are more skinny, you'll want some more ease here to smooth things out a bit.
