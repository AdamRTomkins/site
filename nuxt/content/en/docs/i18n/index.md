title: Documentation for translators
---

If you like to help translate freesewing.org, this is the documentation for you.

## Languages

English is our origin language. Which means that everything is written in English
and then translated from English into other languages.

Those other languages can be anything you want. You can join in the effort of a 
language that's already worked on, or you can start with a new language.


## Types of translation work

There are really only two types of translation:

**Strings**

Strings means all of the words and sentences that are used in the code of the website.
Strings are always stored in YAML files, which have the `.yaml` extension.

For details about the specifics, see the [documentation on translating YAML](/docs/i18n/yaml)
 
The complete set of strings is currently about 750 words and sentences, but they are spread
over different YAML files.

750 lines isn't that much, but you will be translating these strings outside of the context 
they are used, so sometimes you may find that difficult.

When you're not certain in what context a certain word or phrase is used,
[you can simply ask someone](https://gitter.im/freesewing/freesewing).


**Content**

Content are things like documentation, blog posts, and so on. 
Content is always stored in **MarkDown** files, which have the `.md` entension.

For details about the specifics, see the [documentation on translating MarkDown](/docs/i18n/markdown)

While there is a lot more text in all of our content than in the strings,
some people find it easier to translate because you know the full context in which the text is used.

## How we work

> When different people work together on the same set of files,
> it's easy to overwrite each other's work. Without the right tools, avoiding this
> requires a lot of coordination. If you've even emails 15 different versions of some
> document around, you already know this.
> 
> As a loose-knit team of volunteers, coordination is minimal. Instead, we trust technology.
> People have been writing software together for decades, and this problem has long been solved.
> 
> We use git to handle versioning of our files, and they are hosted on GitHub which put a pretty
> web interface on things.
> 
> If you are new to git and/or GitHub you may find it intimidating. However, you will soon discover
> that as far as skills for the modern age go, learning to use GitHub is going to be a nice
> feather in your cap.

You will need a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account. They are free, so you can just go to the website and sign up.

Your GitHub account will also allow you to join
[our chat room on Gitter](https://gitter.im/freesewing/freesewing) which is **the** best place to ask questions.
