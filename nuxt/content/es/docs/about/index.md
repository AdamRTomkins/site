> Freesewing is an open source platform for made-to-measure sewing patterns {.display-2}
 
## About freesewing.org - the site
Freesewing.org generates sewing patterns based on your measurements.

To do so, you enter your measurements, pick your options, and your sewing pattern is drafted for you on the fly.

Once drafted, you can download your pattern as PDF in a variety of printable sizes.
You can also download the source SVG file.

## About freesewing - the project

Freesewing is an open source project entirely run by volunteers.
All our code is freely available [on GitHub](https://github.org/freesewing). All are patterns are free too. 

This is made possible by the hard work of our contributors, and the financial support of [our patrons](/patrons).

If you're interested in the origins of this project, you can read [the freesewing origin story](/docs/about/origin).
## What's in it for me?

What's in it for you depends on what role you see yourself in.

### For makers

All our patterns are free of charge. We provide detailed instructions to make them into garments,
and can help when you get stuck.

We like to [showcase](/showcase) makes from the community, and share your work on our 
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/freesewing_org) and 
[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/freesewing_org/)
accounts. Or checkout the **#freesewing** hashtag.

### For designers

Our patterns are code. Which makes a lot of sense when you think about it.

If you want to design for the freesewing platform, that will involve writing code.
But don't worry, it's not hard and we have excellent documenation.

On the plus side, you have powerful tools at your disposal that take care of a lot
of things for you (no more grading, ever).

You can host your patterns at freesewing.org (for free) or run your own
instance, and sell them. Custom pattern drafts provide your customers 
with a better experience, but also protect you from people copying and passing your
patterns around. Which means you can sell more patterns at a lower price point.

### For developers

All our code is open source, and available [on GitHub](https://github.com/freesewing).

Your pull requests are welcome here, and [our chat room on Gitter](https://gitter.im/freesewing/freesewing) is the best place to ask questions.
