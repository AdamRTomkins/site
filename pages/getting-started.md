## Welcome
Hi there,

This getting started guide will walk you through 
[what freesewing is](#what-is-freesewing), 
[what it does](#what-does-freesewing-the-project-do), 
[what it can do for you](#what-can-freesewing-do-for-me), and 
[how you can contribute to it](#how-can-i-contribute-to-freesewing).

If at any point you feel lost, [help is available](/help).

## What is freesewing?

**[Freesewing is an online platform](#freesewing-is-an-online-platform) that [drafts 
custom sewing patterns](#freesewing-drafts-custom-sewing-patterns) 
[based on your measurements](#freesewing-patterns-are-based-on-your-measurements).**

Before I pick apart what that actually means, 
let's make sure we are all on the same page regarding terminology.

### Freesewing is an online platform

Freesewing is online and web-based. Everything happens in your browser.

If you were looking for an offline tool for pattern drafting,
perhaps [the Valentina project](http://valentina-project.org/) is a better match.

### Freesewing drafts custom sewing patterns

Freesewing does not have a collection of standard patterns for you to download, 
as you might expect from an online pattern store.

We can do better: All freesewing patterns are drafted for you, on the fly, based on your input.

### Freesewing patterns are based on your measurements

Freesewing does not use sizes. It takes your measurements (and options) as input,
and out comes a custom pattern draft.

## What does freesewing (the project) do?

Our work is focussed on three main areas:

### We design patterns

Pattern design is a science. And like all sciences, the best way to get ahead
is to share our work and results openly with the community.

We design patterns to the best of our abilities, and share them freely because we 
are convinced that together with you, we can come up with far better results that 
on our own.

### We write code

No graphical tools are used to generate your pattern draft.
Both the drafting process, and the pattern your draft is based on, are implemented in code.

It's an approach that is perhaps unusual (pattern designers are used to fire up Illustrator, 
not an <abbr title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</abbr>) but fits particularly well with the engineering challenge that are sewing patterns.

Moving a line a bit right or left in a graphical program is subjective, and hard to reproduce.
With code, you know what is going on and what you are changing to the very last detail.

### We provide documentation

This is certainly the most time-consuming work we do.
But we do it nevertheless because we believe it is important.

We try to document everything. From the code we write to how to sew up our patterns.
It's an ongoing process of tiny improvements that's never finished.

## What can freesewing do for me?

What's in it for you depends on what role you see yourself in.

### For makers

All our patterns are free of charge. We provide detailed instructions to make them into garments,
and can help when you get stuck.

We like to showcase makes from the community, and share your work on our 
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/freesewing_org) and 
[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/freesewing_org/)
accounts. Or checkout the #freesewing hashtag.

### For designers

Designing patterns for the freesewing platform has a lot of advantages for you as a designer.

On the technical side, you have powerful tools at your disposal that take care of a lot
of things for you (no more grading, ever).

You can host your patterns at freesewing.org (for free) or run your own
instance, and sell them. Custom pattern drafts provide your customers 
with a better experience, but also protect you from people copying and passing your
patterns around. Which means you can sell more patterns at a lower price point.

### For developers

All our code is open source, and you can fork it [on GitHub](https://github.com/freesewing).

We have documentation to help you use our code in your own projects. 
And our info service makes integration with your front-end child's play.

## How can I contribute to freesewing?

We welcome all contributions, and you might have more to offer than your realize.

### As a maker

Make our patterns, show us your results, spread the word, and provide feedback.

See a mistake somewhere, [tell us about it](/contact). 
Think the documentation needs work? [Let us know](/contact).

Have something to share? Why not [join our Slack channel](/slack)?

### As a designer

We'd love to host your designs on freesewing. If you need any help, [get in touch](/contact).

Do you have designs that you'd like to migrate to freesewing? We'd love to [help you with that](/contact).

Do you want use freesewing to underpin your business? That's great, [reach out to us](/contact). 

Just want to chat? There's a [Slack channel](/slack) for that.

### As a developer

We'll take your pull requests, we'd love to have you join the team, no strings attached.

[Join our Slack channel](/slack) to talk to like-minded people with a love for sewing on a mission
to fix sewing patterns once and for all.

## Where to go from here

If you're a maker, why don't you [check out our range of patterns](/fixme) and [make something](/fixme)?

If you're a designer, I recommend the pattern design tutorial, [part 1](/designer/tutorial/part-1) 
and [part 2](/designer/tutorial/part-2).

If you're a developer, head over to the [developer documentation](/developer).
