Hi there!

Whether you're completely new to freesewing, or you'd like 
a better understanding of its inner workings, you've come 
to the right place. 

This getting started guide will walk you through what 
freesewing is, what it does, what it can do for you, 
and how you can contribute to it.

If at any point you feel lost, know that [help is available](/help).

## What is freesewing?

The [about page](/about) sums it up as follows:

> Freesewing is an online platform to generate sewing patterns 
> based on your measurements.
>
> Our goal is to make pattern drafting as simple as ordering pizza.

It's the kind of definition that is great if you know what 
sewing patterns are, what pattern drafting is, 
and what we mean when we use those terms.

Perhaps you do, perhaps you don't. Either way, 
it's best to start with the basics to make sure we 
are all on the same page.

### Sewing patterns

A sewing pattern is a blueprint to contstruct a garment.
Much a like an architect draws up a plan to build a house, 
a sewing pattern is a plan to make something.

But all patterns are not created equal. Most pattern, 
whether they are paper patterns (sometimes called envelope patterns)
or downloadable (PDF) patterns come in a range of sizes.

Sizes in patterns are just as problematic as sizes in the 
garment industry. They were invented to allow mass production,
and are made for mythical _standard_ person.

But people are not made with cookie cutters. 
No two people are alike, and if you've been to a changing room
recently, it seems that often even no two sizes are alike.

### Pattern drafts

So, patterns that are based on standard sizes are not good enough.
We need something better. And guess what, it exists. As it happens, 
it's how all clothes were made before the industry came up with
standard sizes.

People used to make hand-drafted patterns based on a person's measurements.
These are a lot better, but they require a lot of work.

Well, they used to. That's where freesewing comes in.

### Understanding patterns and drafts in the context of freesewing

In the context of freesewing, We still speak of pattern, but to us, 
a **pattern** is a recipe.

To this recipe, you add your own ingredients: 
**measurements** and **options**. And when we bring a pattern, your measurements, 
and your choice of options together, we can create a pattern draft that
is exactly what you need.

We call this end result a **draft**. A draft is always made just for you.

### Freesewing building blocks

Freesewing brings together three different building blocks:

- Patterns : The recipes that we turn into drafts
- Code : The magic that makes it all happen
- Documentation : Instructions to take you from A to Z

{% include figure.html 
    description="The pattern is the recipe, your measurements and options are the ingredients. Out comes your pattern draft, which you can make with the help of our documentation."
    url="https://api.freesewing.org/?service=draft&pattern=GettingStarted&figure=ingredients&cache=1"
%}

Depending on whether you are a maker, a (pattern) designer, or a (software) developer,
not all of these building blocks may be very relevant to you.

For example, if you're looking to make some new clothes, you might not 
care about how the code works that generates your draft. And that's fine.

Before we look at freesewing can do for each of these roles, let's recap what we've learned.

### What we've learned

- We know what a sewing pattern is
- We've learned that standard sizes don't work
- We've learned that when we talk about a **pattern**, we mean the basic recipe
- We've learned that when we talk about a **draft**, we mean a pattern made to your wishes
- We've learned that **measurements** and **options** are what makes one draft different from the next

## What can freesewing do for me?

### Freesewing for makers

### Freesewing for designers

### Freesewing for developers
