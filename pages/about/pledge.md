There's a lot of misery in the world. As I watch the news, I often feel my faith in humanity slipping.

Some of the most vulnerable people on this planet seem largely abandoned by rich countries and supra-national organisations.

Yet somehow, in some of those worst places to be a human being, there is still a banner flying that provides hope, and help. It's not the flag of the United Nations, nor is it the star spangled banner, or the blue and gold of the European Union.

The one thing that reminds me that humanity has not completely forsaken these people is to see the banner of M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res/Doctors Without Borders fly, precariously, among the rubble of their bombed hospitals.

I can't think of a single symbol that reminds us that not everything is lost, and there's still good people out there.  
I can't think of a single organisation more deserving of our support.

So I am happy to make this pledge:

> ##### Freesewing donations pledge
> I, Joost De Cock, founder and maintainer of the freesewing project and 
> recipient of its donations, hereby pledge that all donations I receive 
> will be passed on to
> [Doctors Without Borders (MSF)](http://www.msf.org/).
> {:.lead}

In practice, all donations received in the previous 12 months will be transfered to MSF once per year, on the 10th of December.



> ##### Caveat
> TL;DR: I promise to donate 100% of what I receive, I'll try to cover the transaction fees (so it's also 100% of what you give).
>  {:.lead }
>
> When you donate, PayPal charges a fee. 
> The donations pledge only applies to the money received, and not to the fee charged.
>
> Historically, I have donated 100% of donations given, and paid the difference 
> (the total of fees) out of my own pocket.
>
> I hope to continue to do that, because I like the idea that 100% of what you
> give goes to charity.
>
> However, I cannot pledge this, because if this project becomes wildly successful,
> it would bankrupt me to pay the transaction fee on all donations.

## Donations history

**Note:** I started accepting donations in November 2014. Donations of those
first couple of weeks are lumped in with the 2015 donations.
