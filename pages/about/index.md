## In a nutshell
Freesewing is an online platform to draft custom sewing patterns based on your measurements.

Our goal is to make pattern drafting as simple as ordering pizza.

## Main parts
The freesewing project is made up of three main parts:

- Patterns: The patterns we make available to users via [freesewing.org](https://freesewing.org/)
- Documentation: The instructions and help available on [docs.freesewing.org](http://docs.freesewing.org/)
- Source code: All of our code is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/freesewing)

## Free as in speech, and beer
What Freesewing does is comparable to what Lekala and Bootstrap Fashion do: provide customized sewing patterns.

But there are two important differences: 

- Freesewing is free of charge. Our patterns are free ([CC-BY](/license)) and our code is free ([GPL-3](/license)).
- This is not a business and is not about making money.

Freesewing is a labour of love.
