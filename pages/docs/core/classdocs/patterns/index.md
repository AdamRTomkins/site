## Pattern namespace list 

- [`Core`](core)

> <h5 class="notoc">Patterns belong in a namespace</h5>
>
> Patterns are organised in namespaces. The channels we ship go under the `Core` namespace
> when they are mature, or in the `Beta` when they are still young and haven't been srutinized that much.
>
> If you add your own patterns, you can add them to the namespace of your choice.
{: .tip }

> <h5 class="notoc">Where is the documentation for pattern x?</h5>
>
> These pages document the core API. As such, it only documents the abstract [`Pattern`](core/pattern) class.
>
> The patterns that extend that class, and implement an actual pattern, or beyond the scope of this documentation.
> 
> If you'd like to make these patterns, please refer to [the documentation for makers](/docs/maker).
> If you'd like to understand their code, you'll have to read the source code.
