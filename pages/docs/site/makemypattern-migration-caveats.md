If you have an account on makemypattern.com, your data will be auto-magically migrated for you when you sign up on freesewing.org.

However, there are a few caveats you should be aware of.

## Migration caveats

### You need to use the same email address

When a new user signs up, we check whether a user with that email address is known on makemypattern.com (MMP). If it is, we migrate their data.

So, if you want to sign up and have your data migrated, it is important to sign up with the same email address as your account on MMP.

While you can change your email address later, the migration will only happen on initial signup.

### We no longer use gender

On MMP, your model had a gender. 
That data is migrated to freesewing's gender-neutral **breasts** or **no breasts** option. 

> If the gender was female, you get breasts. If not, you get no breasts.

### Changes in measurements

While some measurements have their names changed to be more clear, the biggest change is that the measurements that no longer exist.

There's two of them, and in both cases the change is made to make measuring easier for you.

### Shoulder length is gone, use shoulderToShoulder instead

The shoulder length measurements was difficult to use and caused problems in patterns when people measured it wrong.

After feedback from the community, I have dropped it and switched to the shoulderToShoulder measurement that is not only easier to use, but arguable also a better measurement to work with.

> We do not migrate the **shoulder length** measurement, and you will need to add the **shoulderToShoulder** measurement to your model instead.
{:.warning}

### Hood opening is gone, use headCircumference instead

Hood opening was also a measurement that probably was never a good idea to start with, and it's ambigious.

So, we use headCircumference instead, which is kinda self-explanatory.

> We do not migrate the **hoop opening measurement**, and you will need to add the **headCircumference** measurement to your model instead.
{:.warning}

## Things we migrate

With the caveats out of the way, here's what we migrate:

### Username
If your username is available, we'll give you the same username on freesewing as you had on MMP.

> Note that you login with your email address, so the username is less relevant
{:.comment}

### User picture
If you had uploaded a profile picture on MMP, we will migrate it and make it your profile picture on freesewing.org.

If you still had your auto-generated MMP profile picture, and never uploaded your own picture, you will get a new freesewing auto-generated profile picture.

### Models
If you created models, we will migrate those. Their model pictures will be migrated according to the same priciples as the user pictures: If you uploaded a picture, we.ll migrate it. If you stuck to the default, you get the new default.

#### Model gender
As [mentioned in the caveats](#we-no-longer-use-gender), we do migrate the model's gender into our gender-neutral breasts/no breasts option.

#### Model measurements
Apart from the caveats listed above, all model measurements are migrated.
