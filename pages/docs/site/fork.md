## What is a fork?

In software development, a <b>fork</b> is when you make a copy of the source code and use it to _go your own way_. In other words, use that copy as a starting point to create your own version that is different from the original.

Forking a draft is the same thing. You take a copy of an existing draft as the basis of your own draft.

## But that will never fit me

Good point. Given that drafts are made-to-measure, it doesn't make sense to copy the entire draft. 
Instead, we only copy the pattern options. 

Each time we draft a pattern, we combine two ingredients to get the end result:

  - The measurements of the model
  - The pattern options you choose

When you fork a draft, you combine your own model with the (forked) options of another draft.

In other words, you can get a draft that is just like the forked draft, but still made to your measurements.

## How does it work?

Creating a new draft typically takes three steps:

  - You choose a pattern
  - You choose a model
  - You choose the pattern options, or stick with **the pattern's defaults**

When you fork a draft, these steps look like this:

  - The pattern is determined by the draft your are forking
  - You choose a model
  - You choose the pattern options, or stick with **the forked defaults**

In other words, forking a draft is a lot like creating a new draft. 
But the default values for the pattern options are now not the ones configured in the pattern,
but the ones selected in the draft you are forking.

## A simple example

The default number of buttons on simon is 7. 

If you fork a simon draft with 9 buttons, the default becomes 9.

You can still choose 7 buttons, or 8 or 6 or whatever. 
The only thing that changes are the defaults.

## Why would I use this

### To branch out patterns into different styles

Simon (for example) has 41 configurable options. 
Through those options, you can turn it into the most formal dress shirt, a casual lumberjack shirt, or anything in between.

Forks allow you to create a set of options that anybody can copy to get the same look.

### Tweak your own drafts

Imagine you drafted a pattern, made it into a garment, and you're happy with it.

So happy in fact, that you'd like to create another one. Except this time, you'd like just a fraction more ease in the waist because 
they just opened a Krispy Kreme on your block and well, you know.

You can simply fork your earlier draft, change the waist ease, and you have a new draft, just as you want it.

## So how do I do it?

On every draft page, there is a <b>Fork</b> button. Click it, and follow the steps.

To allow others to fork your draft, you need to:

 - Share your draft, (click settings on the draft page and toggle the share button)
 - Give them the URL to your draft

Obviously, for you to be able to share another person's draft, they should have also shared it, and you need the URL.

## I also see a Redraft button. What does that do?

A **redraft** is a special type of fork:

  - It use the same model (you can't choose another one)
  - It's an **in-place** fork. The fork will overwrite the current draft.
