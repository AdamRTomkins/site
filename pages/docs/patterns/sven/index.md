### What you need

To make Sven, you will need the following:

- Basic sewing supplies
- About 1.75 meter of a suitable fabric ([see Fabric options](#fabric-options))
- Ribbing fabric for the cuffs and neck opening

### Fabric options

Sven can be any sweatshirt you want it to be. From wovens to knit or even scuba, you can't really go wrong as long as you stick with something that has a bit of weight to it.

Have a look at [the Sven showcases](/showcase/pattern/sven) for inspiration.

Aaron is a very simply pattern, and consists of two main parts plus some strips for the neck and armhole binding.

## Construction

### Step 1: Close shoulder seams

 - Place the back and front on top of each other with the good sides toghether.
 - Align the shoulder seam, and sew/serge it at the standard seam allowance.
 - Repeat for the other shoulder seam.

> <h5>A serger/overlock is nice, but optional</h5>
> As with all knitwear and stretch fabrics, a serger/overlock will make your life easier.
>
> If you do not have one of those, don't despair. You don't really need it. Because these side seams and shoulder seams won't get stretched out, you can just sew them with a regular straight stitch.

### Step 2: Set in the sleeves

 - Place your now attached front and back with the good side up. 
 - Place a sleeve on top if it with the good side down
 - Aling the top of the sleevecap with the shoulder seam, your sleeve should lie over your front/back extending to the other shoulder seam
 - Pin sleeve in place along the entire armhole. There's a bit of sleevecap ease, which means that the sleevehead is slightly longer than the armhole. Ease this in the top part of the sleeve head while pinning.
 - Sew/serge your pinned sleeve in place
 - Repeat for the other sleeve

### Step 3: Finish the neck binding

 - Measure the length of the neck opening
 - Cut a piece of ribbing that is this length and 6cm/2.5inch wide
 - Fold the ribbing double with the good side outward, and pin it to your neckopening starting from the back
 - The cut off side of your ribbing should align with the edge of your neck opening, while the ribbing extends over your sweatshirt
 - Pin the ribbing in place around the neck opening, starting at the back and stretching it gently as you do so
 - First, join the ribbing at center back, with good sides together. As you've been stretching the ribbing as you were pinning it, it will be too long. Simply cut that away
 - Then, sew the ribbing to the neck opening

### Step 4: Close the side seams and sleeves

 - Fold Sven double at the shoulder seams with good sides together
 - Align the side seams and sleeves and pin them together
 - Now, sew the side seam and continue sewing to close the arms all the way to the cuff
 - Repeat on the other side

### Step 5: Attach the cuffs

 - Measure the width of the sleeve at the cuff
 - Cut a piece of ribbing that is (twice this length - 2cm/1inch) and 7cm/3inch wide
 - Fold the ribbing double along the longest side, and sew together the edge so you have a continous ring
 - Turn your Sven inside-out
 - Fold the ribbing ring with the good side outwards, and slip the folded side into your inside/out Sven sleeve
 - Align the cut off side of the ribbing with the edge of the sleeve and pin it in place. The ribbing is a bit shorter, so stretch it a bit while pinning to work this into the sleeve.
 - Now, sew/serge the ribbing to the sleeve
 - Repeat for the other cuff

### Step 6: Attach the hem

 - Do for the hem as your did for the cuffs
 - Measure the width of Sven at the hem
 - Cut a piece of ribbing that 1.9 times this length and 7cm/3inch wide  
 - You may need to attach different pieces if your ribbing fabric isn't wide enough
 - Fold the ribbing double along the longest side, and sew together the edge so you have a continous ring
 - Turn your Sven inside-out
 - Fold the ribbing ring with the good side outwards, and slip the folded side into your inside/out Sven body
 - Align the cut off side of the ribbing with the edge of the body and pin it in place. The ribbing is a bit shorter, so stretch it a bit while pinning to work this into the body.
 - Now, sew/serge the ribbing to the body
