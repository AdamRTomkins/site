### What you need

To make Carlton, you will need the following:

 - Enough suitable fabric and lining (see [Fabric options](#fabric-options)
 - 8 Buttons
 - Canvas for shaping the collar, shoulders, and fronts
 - Shoulder pads


### Fabric options
{:.clear}

> ##### A coat is a lot of work, treat yourself
>
> Making a coat like this is no small feat. So where possible, pick a nice quality fabric.
> Not only will it make it easier to construct the coat, it will also look better and last longer.
{:.tip}

#### Main fabric
You can't go wrong with wool for this one. It's essentially a winter coat, and nothing is going to keep you warm like wool does.
Go for a heavier wool from the coat section of your local fabric store. 

#### Lining
Any quality lining from the lining section in your local fabric store should do.


> ##### Use a paperless draft to check how much fabric you need
>
> Depending on the width of your fabric, you'll be able to squeeze more things next to each other.
> However, it's likely that you'll need two lenghts of the front/facing behind each other to fit it all on the fabric.
> As such, this will determine exactly how much fabric you need.
>
> You can draft a paperless version of this pattern to know exactly how long the front part will be.
> Double that, and you have the total fabric length required.
{:.tip}

### Caveats

#### Seam allowance
This pattern comes with 2cm seam allowance by default, because coats can use a bit more seam allowance.

However, sometimes only have of the seam allowance is used to reduce bulk.
Keep an eye out for these mixed seam allowances.

#### Canvas and interfacing

A properly constructed coat shell requires canvas and (fusible) interfacing. These parts are not added seperately to your pattern. However, the outline of the back stay and chest piece are marked on the back and front parts respectively.

### Scale

If you printed your pattern, use the scale box to double check that your draft was printed at the correct scale.

## Cutting

> - {:.title} Main fabric
>   - Cut **2 fronts**
>   - Cut **2 front facings** (check for the facing/lining boundary on the front, and don't forget to add seam allowance on that boundary)
>   - Cut **2 Backs**
>   - Cut **2 Tails**
>   - Cut **2 Topsleeves**
>   - Cut **2 Undersleeves**
>   - Cut **4 Belts**
>   - Cut **2 Collar stands**
>   - Cut **2 Collars** (on the fold)
>   - Cut **2 Cuff facings**
>   - Cut **2 Pockets**
>   - Cut **2 Pocket flaps**
>   - Cut **2 Chest pocket welts**
> - {:.title} Lining
>   - Cut **2 fronts**
>   - Cut **2 front linings** (check for the facing/lining boundary on the front, and don't forget to add seam allowance on that boundary)
>   - Cut **2 Backs**
>   - Cut **2 Tails**
>   - Cut **2 Topsleeves**
>   - Cut **2 Undersleeves**

{:.cuts}

> ##### Cutting *with good sides together*
> When cutting out two, you can cut them [good sides together](/docs/sewing/good-sides-together).
> However, when working with fabric with a pattern, I prefer to cut them individually to finely control the pattern matching.
>
> When you cut them individually, remember that they need to be mirror images of each other. So flip either your pattern or your fabric over when cutting the second one.

## Construction

<!-- {% increment step %} skipping 0 so we start from 1 -->

### Step {% increment step %}: Apply fusible interfacing

Iron fusible interfacing to the armholes on the front and back. Do not let the interfacing extend into the seam allowance.


### Step {% increment step %}: Close the back darts
{% include instruction-img.html img='close-the-back-darts.svg' caption='Close the back darts' %}

**Close the darts** in Part 2, the Back. 

 - Fold your back double with good sides together along the center of the dart
 - Sew along the dart line.

When you're done, **press your darts** so they lie flat.

### Step {% increment step %}: Construct the belt
{:.clear}
{% include instruction-img.html img='step02.svg' caption='Construct the belt' %}

Join the belt together:

 - Place two belt pieces with the good sides together
 - Sew around the seamline, making sure to make a neat quarter-circle at the corners.

Now clip, flip, and press:

 - Clip the seam allowance at the corners so they don't get bunched up when turning your belt
 - Turn the belt with the good side out
 - Press your belt

### Step {% increment step %}: Prepare the inner pocket tab
{:.clear}

> ##### The inner pocket tab is optional
>
> This tab is used to close the inner pocket with a button.
> If you don't want that, you can safely leave out this part.
{:.tip}

{% include instruction-img.html img='step03.svg' caption='Preparing the inner pocket tab' %}

 - Fold the pocket tab double with the good sides together, so it forms a new triangle
 - Sew along the non-folded short side
 - Turn the tab with the good side out
 - Press your tab
