### What you need

To make Carlton, you will need the following:

 - Enough suitable fabric and lining (see [Fabric options](#fabric-options)
 - 8 Buttons
 - Canvas for shaping the collar fronts
 - Shoulder pads


### Fabric options
{:.clear}

> ##### A coat is a lot of work, treat yourself
>
> Making a coat like this is no small feat. So where possible, pick a nice quality fabric.
> Not only will it make it easier to construct the coat, it will also look better and last longer.
{:.tip}

#### Main fabric
You can't go wrong with wool for this one. It's essentially a winter coat, and nothing is going to keep you warm like wool does.
Go for a heavier wool from the coat section of your local fabric store. 

#### Lining
Any quality lining from the lining section in your local fabric store should do.


> ##### Use a paperless draft to check how much fabric you need
>
> Depending on the width of your fabric, you'll be able to squeeze more things next to each other.
> However, it's likely that you'll need two lenghts of the front/facing behind each other to fit it all on the fabric.
> As such, this will determine exactly how much fabric you need.
>
> You can draft a paperless version of this pattern to know exactly how long the front part will be.
> Double that, and you have the total fabric length required.
{:.tip}

### Caveats
This pattern comes with 2cm seam allowance by default, because coats can use a bit more seam allowance.

However, sometimes only have of the seam allowance is used to reduce bulk.
Keep an eye out for these mixed seam allowances.

### Scale

If you printed your pattern, use the scale box to double check that your draft was printed at the correct scale.

## Cutting

> - {:.title} Main fabric
>   - Cut **2 fronts**
>   - Cut **2 front facings** (check for the facing/lining boundary on the front, and don't forget to add seam allowance on that boundary)

>   - Cut **2 Tails**
>   - Cut **2 Topsleeves**
>   - Cut **2 Undersleeves**
>   - Cut **4 Belts**

>   - Cut **2 Collars** (on the fold)
>   - Cut **2 Cuff facings**
>   - Cut **2 Pockets**
>   - Cut **2 Pocket flaps**
>   - Cut **2 Chest pocket welts**

> ##### Cutting *with good sides together*
> When cutting out two, you can cut them [good sides together](/docs/sewing/good-sides-together).
> However, when working with fabric with a pattern, I prefer to cut them individually to finely control the pattern matching.
>
> When you cut them individually, remember that they need to be mirror images of each other. So flip either your pattern or your fabric over when cutting the second one.

## Construction


### Step 1: Close the back darts
{% include instruction-img.html img='step01.svg' caption='Close the back darts' %}

**Close the darts** in Part 2, the Back. 

 - Fold your back double with good sides together along the center of the dart
 - Sew along the dart line.

When you're done, **press your darts** so they lie flat.

### Step 2: Construct the belt
{:.clear}
{% include instruction-img.html img='step02.svg' caption='Construct the belt' %}

Join the belt together:

 - Place two belt pieces with the good sides together
 - Sew around the seamline, making sure to make a neat quarter-circle at the corners.

Now clip, flip, and press:

 - Clip the seam allowance at the corners so they don't get bunched up when turning your belt
 - Turn the belt with the good side out
 - Press your belt
