> <h5>This documentation is incomplete</h5>
> Cathrin is lacking documentation. Essentially, I haven't found the time to write it yet.
> Probably not helped by the fact that I don't tend to make many corsets.
>
> That being said, [here's helpful post about sewing corsets](https://katafalk.wordpress.com/2009/05/03/how-i-sew-corsets/)
> that you can refer to.

> <h5>Required measurements and pattern options</h5>
> What we do have is documentation on the [required measurements](/measurements/for/cathrin) and [options](/patterns/aaron/cathrin) of this pattern.
