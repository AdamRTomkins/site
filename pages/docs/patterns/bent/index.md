## Bent is a block, not a full pattern

A block is a basic shape on which other patterns are based.
They are sometimes also called slopers, although purists will argue that a block and a sloper are different things.

Point is, there is no point in providing instructions on how to make Bent.

That's because Bent is not supposed to be made, but rather can serve as the basis for your own pattern designs.
