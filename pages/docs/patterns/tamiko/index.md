## Before you start

### What you need

To make Tamiko, you will need the following:

- Basic sewing supplies
- About 1 meter of a suitable fabric ([see Fabric options](#fabric-options))

### Fabric options

This pattern has a lot of unfinished edges, so you need something that does not ravel. And you want to go for something with a nice drape.

Long story short, go for a knitted fabric, or some light scuba or something. No wovens.

## Cutting

> <h5>Summary</h5>
> - {:.title} Main fabric
>   - Cut 1 **Tamiko top** [on the fold](/fixme)
> {:.cuts}
{:.cuts}

Tamiko is a zero-waste pattern. It's a rectangle that's cut out on the fold. Not more than that.

Below is a typical draft layout:

### Part 1: Tamiko top

There's only one part to this top, we we simply refer to it at the **Tamiko top**.
It needs to be cut on the fold along the bottom.

> <h5>Caveats</h5>
> - Cut out the armhole, but leave seam allowance
{:.warning}

## Construction

### Step 1: Finish the armhole seam

Finish the armhole seam with a narrow hem.

### Step 2: Finish the top

> As your top is folded, it's a good idea to pin both halves together.
> This way, your top can't shift around while we finish it.
{:.tip}

Sew the three seamlines that are marked on your draft.
