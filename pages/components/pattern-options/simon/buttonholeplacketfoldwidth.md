The width of the fold on a classic style buttonhole placket.

> If you have a fabric with a pattern (striped or checkers for example) you can set the fold to half the width of your repeating pattern. This way, your pattern will match perfectly.
{:.tip}

> This only applies to a classic placket. So it will be ignored if you opted for a seamless buttonhole placket style.
