How much the collar is taller than the collar stand at center back.

> <h5>What's the point?</h5>
>
>The collar starts upwards from the collar stand and then rolls over downwards. But it still needs to cover the collar stand. For that, it needs to be a bit longer.
>
> Increasing this does not make the collar higher (use the collar stand height for that) but rather makes it descend further down.
