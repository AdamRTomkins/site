Do you want the buttonhole placket to be part of the left front pattern part (cut-on), or rather an individual part that you sew on (seperate)?

The default is grown on.

> <h5>Why pick seperate?</h5>
> One reason to pick a sewn on buttonhole placket is that it allows you to use a different fabric or grainline. Even when using the same fabric, some people also prefer the look of a seperate buttonhole placket.
>
> Having a sewn on placket also gives you more flexibility for pattern matching when using a non-plain fabric. 
> However, you can keep a cut-on placket and instead change the buttonhole placket fold width to match your pattern.
