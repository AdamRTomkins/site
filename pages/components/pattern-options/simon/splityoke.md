Do you want a split yoke?

> <h5>What's the point?</h5>
>
> With a split yoke, only have the yoke is included on the pattern, and you'll have to cut 4 instead of 2, and sew them together.
>
> It's a bit more work, but it allows you to align the grain line differently on both sides of the yoke, and effect that some people like.
