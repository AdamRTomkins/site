{% include pattern-option.html pattern='aaron' option='stretchFactor' %}

How much does your fabric stretch?  Choose 100% if your fabric does not stretch. 

If you choose 90& (for example) for every 10cm of fabric, we'll only draft 9cm.
This way, 9cm of fabric will be stretched to 10cm, which is why we call that a 90% stretch factor.

> This <b>stretchFactor</b> option does only impact stretch one-way (horizontal). 
>
> Four-way stretch is not really a concern for this top, but if you want you can play with the <b>lenghtBonus</b> option.
{:.warning}

> If you're not sure what to pick, best is to take the fabric you are going to make your top out and see how much fabric 
> you need to stretch out to get to 10 cm with a _good_ stretch.
