{% include pattern-option.html pattern='trent' option='backCurveFactor' %}

This option controls the bend of the back seam curve (in the back trouser panel).

Higher values make the crotch curve deeper, and more scooped out.
Lower values result in a flatter curve and thus a shorter crossseam.

Choose a too high value, and the deeply curved backseam will pull and wrinkle your bum.

Choose a too low value and you'll get a _wedgie_.

> It's best to start with the default and only tweak this after a muslin test shows it's needed.
