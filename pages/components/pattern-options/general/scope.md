This is an option that allows you to only include certain pattern parts.

This is typically used in one of these scenarios:

 - You have an assymetric body, and are generating two patterns with different measurements. You don't need all parts double, so you select only those you want.
 - You have a draft, and are only changing certain things about it (like the collar on a shirt) so you only want those parts
