Determines how much seam allowance to add to the pattern.

Modern metric patterns typically come with 1cm seam allowance, whereas vintage patterns use 1.5cm seam allowance.

In countries that use the imperial system for sewing patterns, the vintage 1.5cm is still in use.
Or rather, <sup>5</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch which is the same distance.

Some people prefer not to add seam allowance to the pattern, so that's an option too.
