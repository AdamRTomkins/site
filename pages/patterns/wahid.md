tagline: This is a fitted waistcoat with front darts and differnet styles
description: "<p>Wahid comes with two different neck lines, two hem styles, and a number of other options to control its appearance.</p>This pattern has darts at the center back, and both at the front and back of the armhole. But all of these are rotated out of your way to make sewing this up easier. You'll only have to take care of the front darts.</p>"
