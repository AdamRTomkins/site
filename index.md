Freesewing is a free and open source 
platform to generate sewing patterns. 

## Reading

You probably want go to the [tags](tags) page.
It's the best place to find things given that 
most of this site is under construction.

Also note that the 
[documentation rendered by GitHub](https://joostdecock.github.io/freesewing-docs/) 
runs a bit behind as it's based on the master branch.

If you want the latest and greatest (and potentially most broken) 
documentation work, you can see it at 
[http://freesewing.org:8000/](http://freesewing.org:8000/)
which serves up my (Joost's) working copy of the develop branch.

## Writing

Documentation is maintained in the 
[freesewing-docs repository on GitHub](https://github.com/joostdecock/freesewing-docs).

It's public, so if you want to contribute &mdash; even if it's just to fix a 
typo or broken link &mdash; feel free to fork it.

## Building

The develop branch is where the action is, yet the documentation on
[https://joostdecock.github.io/freesewing-docs/](https://joostdecock.github.io/freesewing-docs/)
is auto-generated from the master branch.

If you want to work on this, you'll probably want to run your own instance 
to see changes as they happen.

We are using Jekyll for the documentation. Good places to start are the 
[GitHub pages documentation](https://pages.github.com/) 
and [the Jekyll site](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/).

If you've change questions, [the slack channel](https://freesewing.slack.com/)
is a good place to ask them.
