            <p class="lead">This site is a work in progress</p>
            <p>Specifically, it's here to test/develop our data API which stores user info.</p>
            <p>Here's what you can do:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sign up for an account</li>
                <li>Remove your account</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I know, it's not much but it's a start. And, if you have a makemypattern.com account, your data will/should be migrated with you.</p>
