## About this site

This site is a work in progress. It is to become the main freesewing site.

This site is a fork of  
[our docs repository](https://github.com/freesewing/docs).
So it's based on Jekyll, and statically hosted by Netlify.

Because forks can't live in the same organisation, it's currently under 
[my personal GitHub account](https://github.com/joostdecock/site).
But don't let that stop you, feel free contribute or just mess around with it.

The frontend has gone through some changes, and 
contains a bunch of jQuery code that interacts with the data API.

The what? The data API.

[This repository](https://github.com/freesewing/data) holds a new API I hacked together based on the 
[PHP Slim framework](http://slimframework.com/).

There's a lot it doesn't do yet, but things are starting to take shape.

## How did we get here?

As some of you [may have noticed](https://gitter.im/freesewing/freesewing?at=58f8d08b881b89e1016c19c4),
I got more than a little frustrated trying to build a frontend for freesewing.

It's because I was trying to do too many new things at once, in an attempt to make something that's great.

So, I've somewhat scaled back my ambitions and I'm trying to get something up and running. 
We can hopefully make it great later.

I'm still dabbling with new stuff (I have never used Slim before, so it's probably kinda hackish)
but I'm using jQuery on the client side (and not Vue or React or Angular or Ember or....) because
I can at least get that to work.

I am painfully aware that there's far superior ways to do what I'm doing. 
But hey, we can always make it great after I make it work.
