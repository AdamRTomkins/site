### What you need

To make {{ page.pattern | capitalize }}, you will need the following:

 - Enough suitable fabric and lining (see [Fabric options](#fabric-options))
 - 8 Buttons
 - Canvas for shaping the collar, shoulders, back stay, and fronts
 - Shoulder pads
 - Some fusible interfacing


### Fabric options
{:.clear}

> ##### A coat is a lot of work, treat yourself
>
> Making a coat like this is no small feat. So where possible, pick a nice quality fabric.
> Not only will it make it easier to construct the coat, it will also look better and last longer.
{:.tip}

#### Main fabric
You can't go wrong with wool for this one. It's essentially a winter coat, and nothing is going to keep you warm like wool does.
Go for a heavier wool from the coat section of your local fabric store. 

#### Lining
Any quality lining from the lining section in your local fabric store should do.


> ##### Use a paperless draft to check how much fabric you need
>
> Depending on the width of your fabric, you'll be able to squeeze more things next to each other.
> However, it's likely that you'll need two lenghts of the front/facing behind each other to fit it all on the fabric.
> As such, this will determine exactly how much fabric you need.
>
> You can draft a paperless version of this pattern to know exactly how long the front part will be.
> Double that, and you have the total fabric length required.
{:.tip}

### Caveats

#### Seam allowance
This pattern comes with 2cm seam allowance by default, because coats can use a bit more seam allowance.

However, sometimes only have of the seam allowance is used to reduce bulk.
Keep an eye out for these mixed seam allowances.

#### Canvas and interfacing

A properly constructed coat shell requires canvas and (fusible) interfacing. These parts are not added seperately to your pattern, but their outline is marked on your pattern pieces.

#### Scale

If you printed your pattern, use the scale box to double check that your draft was printed at the correct scale.

{:.cuts}

> ##### Cutting *with good sides together*
> When cutting out two, you can cut them [good sides together](/docs/sewing/good-sides-together).
> However, when working with fabric with a pattern, I prefer to cut them individually to finely control the pattern matching.
>
> When you cut them individually, remember that they need to be mirror images of each other. So flip either your pattern or your fabric over when cutting the second one.

## Construction

<!-- {% increment step %} skipping 0 so we start from 1 -->

### Step {% increment step %}: Apply fusible interfacing
{% include instruction-img.html img='apply-fusible-interfacing.svg' caption='Apply fusible interfacing' %}

Iron fusible interfacing to:

 - The cuff facings
 - The sleevecap on the topsleeve and undersleeve parts
 - The armholes on the front and back
 - The shoulder seam on front and back
 - The neckline at the back

> ##### Make sure to extend the interfacing into the seam allowance
>
> Make sure that your interfacing extends into the seam allowance so that it gets caught in your seam.
{:.tip.clear}

### Step {% increment step %}: Join canvas chest piece to the front canvas
{% include instruction-img.html img='join-chest-canvas-piece-to-front-canvas.svg' caption='Join canvas chest piece to the front canvas' %}

Place the canvas chest piece on your canvas piece of the front panel and baste them together.

> ##### Make sure to extend the canvas into the seam allowance
>
> Make sure that your canvas extends into the seam allowance so that it gets caught in your seam.
{:.tip.clear}

### Step {% increment step %}: Attach canvas to the front part
{% include instruction-img.html img='attach-canvas-to-front.svg' caption='Attach the canvas to your front part' %}

Place your front canvas with the joined canvas chest piece on your front which has the fusible interfacing applied to it.

Baste them together.

> ##### Make sure non of your stitches will show
>
> Make sure to baste them together in the seam allowance, this will avoid that your stitches show on the 
> good side of the fabric.
{:.warning.clear}

### Step {% increment step %}: Pad-stitch the lapels
{% include instruction-img.html img='pad-stitch-lapels.svg' caption='Pad stitch the lapels' %}

Now it's time to pad-stitch your lapels. This is going to take a while, but think about
how cool it's going to look when you post that picture of your finshed pad stitching on social media.

> ##### Not sure about pad stitching?
>
> If you're new to pad-stitching, check out the relevant documentation page: 
> [Pad stitching](/fixme).
>
> FIXME: This page doesn't exist yet.
{:.tip.clear}


### Step {% increment step %}: Tape the roll line

 - Place your twill tape along the roll line, but make sure to keep it about 3mm (or 1/8") inside the roll line.
 - Pin the tape in place at the bottom of the roll line, then lie it flat along the roll line
 - At the top of the roll line, mark the point on the tape where it crosses the neck seam line
 - Now mark your tape about 6mm (1/4") before that point. We're going to make the tape a bit shorter than our roll line, as this will help to make the lapels curve nicely around your body
 - Pin your tape in place at the mark you've just made, then stretch the tape evenly across your roll line and pin it in place
 - Hand-sew both edges of the tape to your front, making sure to prevent your stitches from showing at the front






<!--

### Step {% increment step %}: Close the back darts
{% include instruction-img.html img='close-the-back-darts.svg' caption='Close the back darts' %}

**Close the darts** in Part 2, the Back. 

 - Fold your back double with good sides together along the center of the dart
 - Sew along the dart line.

When you're done, **press your darts** so they lie flat.

### Step {% increment step %}: Construct the belt
{:.clear}
{% include instruction-img.html img='step02.svg' caption='Construct the belt' %}

Join the belt together:

 - Place two belt pieces with the good sides together
 - Sew around the seamline, making sure to make a neat quarter-circle at the corners.

Now clip, flip, and press:

 - Clip the seam allowance at the corners so they don't get bunched up when turning your belt
 - Turn the belt with the good side out
 - Press your belt

### Step {% increment step %}: Prepare the inner pocket tab
{:.clear}

> ##### The inner pocket tab is optional
>
> This tab is used to close the inner pocket with a button.
> If you don't want that, you can safely leave out this part.
{:.tip}

{% include instruction-img.html img='step03.svg' caption='Preparing the inner pocket tab' %}

 - Fold the pocket tab double with the good sides together, so it forms a new triangle
 - Sew along the non-folded short side
 - Turn the tab with the good side out
 - Press your tab
