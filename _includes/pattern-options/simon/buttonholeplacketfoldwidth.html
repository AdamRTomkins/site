<p>The width of the fold on a classic style buttonhole placket.</p>

<blockquote class="tip">
  <p>If you have a fabric with a pattern (striped or checkers for example) you can set the fold to half the width of your repeating pattern. This way, your pattern will match perfectly.</p>

<blockquote class="warning">
  <p>This only applies to a classic placket. So it will be ignored if you opted for a seamless buttonhole placket style.</p>
