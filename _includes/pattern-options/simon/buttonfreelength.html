<p>How much before your waistband do you want your last button to sit?</p>

  <h5>What's the point?</h5>

  <p>Having buttons below your waistband is considered by many to be an annoyance. 
They get caught up in your belt, and complicate bathroom breaks.</p>

  <p>By default, the last button sits 1cm above your waistband, but this option allows you to move it further upwards for that shirt you are going to wear with those high-waisted trousers.</p>

  <p>If you want to have buttons below your waistband, you can. You should enter a negative value here, making sure it's within the length bonus you have available.</p>
