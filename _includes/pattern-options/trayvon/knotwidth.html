<p>The knot width is the width in the middle of the tie, where you make the knot.</p>

<p>How wide your tie is in the middle will influence the tie knot. Go wide for big and bulky knots, go narrow for small knots.</p>

<blockquote class="warning">
  <p>Do not make the knot width larger than the tip width</p>
