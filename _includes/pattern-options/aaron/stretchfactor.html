{% include pattern-option.html pattern='aaron' option='stretchFactor' %}
<p>How much does your fabric stretch?  Choose 100% if your fabric does not stretch.</p>

<p>If you choose 90% (for example) for every 10cm of fabric, we'll only draft 9cm.
This way, 9cm of fabric will be stretched to 10cm, which is why we call that a 90% stretch factor.</p>

<blockquote class="warning">
  <p>This <b>stretchFactor</b> option does only impact stretch one-way (horizontal).</p>

  <p>Four-way stretch is not really a concern for this top, but if you want you can play with the <b>lenghtBonus</b> option.</p>

<blockquote class="tip">
  <p>If you're not sure what to pick, best is to take the fabric you are going to make your top out and see how much fabric 
you need to stretch out to get to 10 cm with a <em>good</em> stretch.</p>
