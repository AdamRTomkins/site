<p>How much room do you want at the hips?</p>

<p>Whatever value you provide here will simply be added to your hips circumference measurement when drafting the garment.</p>

<blockquote class="comment">
  <p>This option also allows negative values.</p>

  <p>You should only use negative ease if you are using a stretch material that you want to fit tightly.</p>

  <p>Overal stretch should be configured with the stretchFactor option.</p>
