<p>How much room do you want at the chest?</p>

<p>Whatever value you provide here will simply be added to your chest circumference measurement when drafting the garment.</p>

<blockquote class="warning">Given that an undershirt has no arms, a little chest ease goes a long way. Add too much, and you'll end up with gaping armholes.</blockquote>

<blockquote class="comment"> 
<h5>This option also allows negative values</h5
<p>You should only use negative ease if you are using a stretch material that you want to fit tightly.</p>
<p>Overal stretch should be configured with the stretchFactor option.</p>
