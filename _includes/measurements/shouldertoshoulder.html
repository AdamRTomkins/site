{% include measurementTabs.html measurement="shouldertoshoulder" %}

<p>The <strong>shoulder to shoulder</strong> measurement runs from the tip of your shoulder on one side across your back to the tip of your other shoulder.</p>

<p>To measure your <strong>shoulder to shoulder</strong> find the edge of your shoulder where on a good fitting shirt the shoulder seam would sit.
Then, measure from there across your back to the same point at the other side.</p>
