<p>The <strong>hips to upper leg</strong> is measured at the side of your body from your hipline down to the upper part of your leg.</p>

<p>To measure your <strong>hips to upper leg</strong> measurement, put a tape measure at the side of your body where your hips sit (where you wear your belt)
and measure down to where your leg starts being a leg, and no longer is part of your bum.</p>
