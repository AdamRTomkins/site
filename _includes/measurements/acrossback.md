Your **acrossBack** is the measurement horizontally across your shoulder blades. 
Think of it as the width of your back without your arms.

To measure your **acrossBack**, 
measure horizontally at the widest part of your back, 
from one side to the other.

Do not include your arms,
but measure between where the sleeves of a good fitting shirt would start.
