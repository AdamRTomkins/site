The **shoulder to wrist** measurement runs from the edge of your shoulder down your arm to your wrist.

To measure your **shoulder to wrist**, start at the edge of your shoulder, 
where your sleeve starts at a well-fitting shirt. Follow your arm, making sure to keep it in natural (slightly-bend) position, down to your wrist.
