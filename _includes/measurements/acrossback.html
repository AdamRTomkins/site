{% include measurementTabs.html measurement="acrossback" %}

<p>Your <strong>acrossBack</strong> is the measurement horizontally across your shoulder blades. 
Think of it as the width of your back without your arms.</p>

<p>To measure your <strong>acrossBack</strong>, 
measure horizontally at the widest part of your back, 
from one side to the other.</p>

<p>
The across back can be measured with a straight ruler.
Do not include your arms or curve around your body, 
but measure flat across between where the sleeves of a good fitting shirt would start.
