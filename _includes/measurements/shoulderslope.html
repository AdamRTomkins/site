<p>The <strong>shoulder slope</strong> measurement is an indicator for the amount with which your shoulder slopes downward. 
You can not measure it directly, but need to calculate the difference between two measurements to find it.</p>

<p>To calculate your <strong>shoulder slope</strong>, tie a ribbon or elastic around your chest, making sure to keep it horizontal.</p>

<p>Then, measure the distance from the front of the ribbon (at your chest) to the back of the ribbon (at your back). Do this both at the side of your neck right next to the base, and at the tip of your shoulder.</p>

<p>Your shoulder slope is the measurement at the base of your neck minus the measurement at the tip of your shoulder.</p>

<p>If your shoulder perfectly horizontal (square shoulders) the shoulder slope will approach zero. The more your shoulders slope, the higher your shoulder slope will be.</p>
