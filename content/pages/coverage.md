## What is test coverage?

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage):

> In computer science, test coverage is a measure used 
> to describe the degree to which the source code of a program 
> is executed when a particular test suite runs. 
> 
> A program with high test coverage, measured as a percentage, 
> has had more of its source code executed during testing which 
> suggests it has a lower chance of containing undetected 
> software bugs compared to a program with low test coverage.
>
> Many different metrics can be used to calculate test coverage; 
> some of the most basic are the percentage of program subroutines 
> and the percentage of program statements called during execution 
> of the test suite.
